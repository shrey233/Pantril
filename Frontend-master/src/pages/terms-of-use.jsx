        <span>
          You confirm and acknowledge that Pantri may modify, suspend, disrupt
          or discontinue any part of the Website, whether to all users or to you
          specifically, at any time with or without notice. You agree and

          information provided to Pantri may not be completely accurate or may
          change after it is provided to Pantri and therefore may not be
          immediately reflected within the product information provided within
